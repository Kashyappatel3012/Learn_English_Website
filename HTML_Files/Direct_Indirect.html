                <h1 id="Welcome">Converting Direct Speech to Indirect Speech</h1>
                <p>
                    Indirect speech, also known as reported speech, is a grammatical and stylistic device used to convey someone else's words without quoting them directly. Converting direct speech to indirect speech involves making changes to pronouns, verb tenses, and other elements to fit the context of the reporting sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Introduction:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Indirect speech, unlike direct speech, doesn't use quotation marks. It involves conveying the meaning of the original speaker's words with necessary changes.<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Example: She said, "I love this place." -> She said that she loved that place.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Changes in Pronouns:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Pronouns in the reported speech might need adjustment to fit the context of the reporting sentence.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: "I am busy," she said. -> She said that she was busy.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Changes in Verb Tenses:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; In reported speech, verb tenses may shift back in time similar to direct speech. Present simple becomes past simple, and present continuous becomes past continuous.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: "I work hard," he said. -> He said that he worked hard.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Changes in Time Expressions:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Time expressions may also need adjustment when converting direct speech to indirect speech.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: "I will come tomorrow," she said. -> She said that she would come the next day.
                    <br><br>
                    5. Changes in Modal Verbs:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Modal verbs like "can," "will," "must," etc., undergo changes in reported speech.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: "I can swim," he said. -> He said that he could swim.
                    <br><br>
                    6. Changes in Reporting Verbs:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; The choice of reporting verbs can affect the structure of indirect speech.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: "I'll help you," she promised. -> She promised to help me.
                    <br><br>
                    7. Direct and Indirect Speech with Different Tenses:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; Example: Present simple -> past simple, Present continuous -> past continuous, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mastering the conversion from direct to indirect speech for different tenses is crucial for effective communication in writing. Practice changing direct speech into indirect speech with various examples to enhance your language skills.

                <h1 id="Welcome">સીધા સરસ થી પરોક્ષ ભાષામાં રૂપાંતર</h1>
                <p>
                    પરોક્ષ ભાષા, જેમણે રિપોર્ટેડ સ્પીચ પણ કહેવામાં આવે છે, એ એક વ્યાકરણાત્મક અને શૈલિશાસ્ત્રમાંનો સાધન છે જેથી કોઈના શબ્દોને ખુબ ચોકીંતી વગર સાંબોધન કરવામાં આવે છે. સીધા સરસને પરોક્ષ ભાષામાં રૂપાંતર કરવામાં, પ્રોનાઉન, વર્બ ટેન્સ, અને અન્ય ઘટકોમાં બદલાવ કરવાનો અંગ્રેજીના રિપોર્ટીંગ વાક્યના સંદર્ભમાં ફિટ કરવો છે.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. પરિચય:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; પરોક્ષ ભાષા, સીધી ભાષા જોઈએ, આવડ માર્કથી વાપરાય છે નહિ. આવડ કરવાની પ્રક્રિયા કરવામાં જરૂરી બદલાવામાં શામીલ થવાનું રહેવાનું રહેવાનું.
                    &rarr;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: તેમને બોલવું, "હું આ સ્થળને પસંદ કરું છું." -> તેને કહ્યું કે તે આ સ્થળને પસંદ કરે છે.
                    <br><br>
                    2. પ્રોનાઉનમાં બદલાવ:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; રિપોર્ટેડ સ્પીચમાં પ્રોનાઉન્સ, રિપોર્ટેડ સંદર્ભમાંને જોવાનો પરિવ્રત્તન કરવો શક્યો છે.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: "હું વ્યસ્ત છું," તેમને કહ્યું. -> તેમને કહ્યું કે તે વ્યસ્ત છે.
                    <br><br>
                    3. વર્બ ટેન્સમાં બદલાવ:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; રિપોર્ટેડ સ્પીચમાં, વર્બ ટેન્સે સરસ સાથે પાછા જવાનો અનુભવ થાય છે જેમ કે સીધા સરસ. વર્તમાન સાધે પાસેલ વર્તમાન સાધે, અને વર્તમાન ચાલુ થવાને વર્તમાન ચાલુ થાય છે.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: "હું મજબૂત કરું છું," તેમને કહ્યું. -> તેમને કહ્યું કે તે મજબૂત કરે છે.
                    <br><br>
                    4. સમય અભિવ્યક્તિઓમાં બદલાવ:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; સીધા સરસને પરોક્ષ ભાષામાં રૂપાંતર કરવામાં સમય અભિવ્યક્તિઓને પરિવર્તનારી જરૂર થવાનું શક્ય છે.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: "હું કાલ આવશે," તેમને કહ્યું. -> તેમને કહ્યું કે તે આવતા દિવસે આવશે.
                    <br><br>
                    5. મોડલ વર્બ્સમાં બદલાવ:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; "કરી શકાય," "કરીશ," "કરવું," વગેરે જેમના મોડલ વર્બ્સ, રિપોર્ટેડ સ્પીચમાં બદલાવામાં આવવાનું છે.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: "હું તરત કરી શકું છું," તેમને કહ્યું. -> તેમને કહ્યું કે તે તરત કરી શકે છે.
                    <br><br>
                    6. રિપોર્ટિંગ વર્બ્સમાં બદલાવ:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; રિપોર્ટિંગ વર્બ્સના ચયનથી પરોક્ષ ભાષાના સરકારીતામાં પરિવર્તન થવું શક્યું છે.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: "હું તને સહાય કરીશ," તેમને વાગ્યું. -> તેમને વાગ્યું કે તે મને સહાય કરશે.
                    <br><br>
                    7. વિવિધ ટેન્સમાં સીધા અને પરોક્ષ ભાષા:<br>
                    &rarr;&nbsp; ઉદાહરણ: પ્રસ્તાવના સરળ -> અત્યંત સરળ, વર્તમાન ચાલુ -> અત્યંત સરળ, વગેરે.
                </p>
                <p>
                    વિવિધ ટેન્સમાં સીધા અને પરોક્ષ ભાષાના રૂપાંતર કરવામાં માહત્વપૂર્ણ છે જેમ કે લખાણમાં કરતાં યોગ્ય રહેવાનું. વિવિધ ઉદાહરણોથી સીધા સરસને પરોક્ષ ભાષામાં બદલાવ કરવામાં આપના ભાષા કૌશલ વધારવાનો અભ્યાસ કરો.
